# Weather Dashboard
Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city. The application uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and dynamically displays the results. It also saves a history of previously searched cities, allowing users to easily revisit the weather for those locations.

## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a simple, easy-to-use tool for viewing both current weather and a 5-day weather forecast for cities around the world. Users can enter a city name to search for its weather data, which is then displayed in two sections:
Current Weather: Displays temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions for the current day.
5-Day Forecast: Displays the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions for the next five days.
The search history is stored in local storage, so previous city searches are saved and can be revisited with a single click.

## Features
City Search: Search for any cityâ€™s weather by entering its name.
Current Weather Display: Displays the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
5-Day Forecast: Shows weather information for the next five days.
Search History: Saves searched cities and displays them as clickable buttons for easy re-search.
Responsive Design: Works on a variety of screen sizes.
Random City Weather: If no cities are in search history, the app will display weather for a random city.

## Technologies
HTML5: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling, including external Bootstrap for responsive design.
JavaScript (ES6): DOM manipulation, data fetching, and event handling.
OpenWeather API: Used to fetch weather data.
